angular-material-flags
======================

AngularJS directive to use national flags in Angular-Material projects with custom fill-color and size.

This project is inspired by the [angular-material-icons](https://github.com/klarsys/angular-material-icons) project, which accomplishes the same objectives with Google's official [material-design-icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons) repository.

Standard national flag `svg` icon files are courtesy of the [flag-icon-css](https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css) project.

A [live demo](https://loljoho.github.com/angular-material-flags) is in the works.
